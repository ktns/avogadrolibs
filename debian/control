Description: chemical editor and visualization application - headers
 Avogadro 2 is a chemical editor and visualization application, it is also a
 set of reusable software libraries written in C++ using principles of
 modularity for maximum reuse. The development of the first generation Avogadro
 application and library is documented in our paper, and this remains the
 preferred method of citation at present. The motivation for rewriting
 Avogadro, along with improvements and changes made in Avogadro 2 are
 summarized in our Source article. We provide a set of permissively licensed,
 open source, cross platform software components in the Avogadro 2 libraries,
 along with an end-user application with full source code, and binaries.
 This package includes library headers.
